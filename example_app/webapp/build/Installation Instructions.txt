Installation instructions

Step 1) Run example_db.sql in your local MySQL installation. This script will create the database and populate it with some dummy data.

Step 2) Install exampleapp.war in Tomcat.

Step 3) After deploy edit file {Apache Tomcat installation directory}\webapps\exampleapp\WEB-INF\spring\appServlet\servlet-context.xml and change entries username, password and url to the ones required by your local MySQL installation. NOTE: Do not change the name of the database in url. It should be example_db.

Step 4) Restart the application.

Step 5) Use http://localhost:{Tomcat port}/exampleapp


NOTES: 
1) The application needs Tomcat version 7 and above to run properly.
2) If the MySQL connector is not included in Tomcat then copy/paste file mysql-connector-java-5.1.29.jar to {Apache Tomcat installation directory}\lib folder.
