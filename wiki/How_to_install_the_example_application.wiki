==Installation instructions==

The application files are located in trunk/exampleapp/webapp/build. Prerequisites to run the application are Tomcat 7.x and MySQL 5.x.

Step 1) Run example db.sql in your local MySQL installation. This script will create the database and populate it with some dummy data.

Step 2) Shut down Tomcat.

Step 3) If the MySQL connector is not included in Tomcat then copy/paste file mysql-connector-java-5.1.21.jar to {Apache Tomcat installation directory}\lib folder.

Step 4) Change entries username, password and url in file exampleapp.xml to the ones required by your local MySQL installation. NOTE: Do not change the name of the database in url. It should be example_app.

Step 5) Put exampleapp.xml in {Apache Tomcat installation directory}\conf\Catalina\localhost.

Step 6) Put exampleapp.war in {Apache Tomcat installation directory}\webapps.

Step 7) Start Tocmat.

Step 8) Use http://localhost:{Tomcat port}/exampleapp


NOTES:
